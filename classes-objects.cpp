/* 

classes/objects

classes - serves as a blueprint for objects, which are instances of the class [just like age is an instance of int - int age]

components of a class are called class members [you can access class members using the dot operator - object.class_member]
two types of class members:
- attributes [also known as member data] consist of information about an instance of the class.
- methods [also known as member functions] are functions that you can use with an instance of the class
  [use a . before method names to distinguish them from regular functions]
