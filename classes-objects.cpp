/* 

classes/objects

classes - serves as a blueprint for objects, which are instances of the class [just like age is an instance of int - int age]
- empty classes are useless
- must declare a method inside the class if we want to define it outside
- by default, everything in a class is private [class members are limited to the scope of the class, ezer for not altering data]
- set class public [can use it to make everything below accessible outside the class]
- set private access modifier for when you want something below public to be private to the class

components of a class are called class members [you can access class members using the dot operator - object.class_member]
two types of class members:
- attributes [also known as member data] consist of information about an instance of the class.
- methods [also known as member functions] are functions that you can use with an instance of the class
  [use a . before method names to distinguish them from regular functions]

constructor - a special kind of method that lets you decide how the objects of a class get created
- has the same name as the class and no return type
- best when used to instantiate an object with specific attributes

object - an instance of a class that encapsulates data and functionality pertaining to that data
create (or instantiate) an object:     City nameofcity;
set objectâ€™s attributes values:        nameofcity.population = 123456789;
using a method created in a class      nameofcity.get_population();
